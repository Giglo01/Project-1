            <h1>“Midnight at Petra”</h1>
            <pre>At midnight, the tour group had long gone. Ravi stayed behind,
hiding in the shadows. When the moon rose, the rose-colored stone
of Petra glowed. He swore he heard ancient whispers and saw
figures dancing through the carved arches. He left before dawn,
changed and silent.
