            <h1>“Wrong Train, Right Place”</h1>
            <pre>Ella boarded the wrong train in Tokyo. She didn’t speak the
language, had no signal, and panicked. An old man noticed, smiled, 
and motioned for her to follow. He led her to a quiet mountain
town, where she stayed a week, learned to make soba, and forgot
she was ever lost.</pre>
